Plant Disease Recognition System
Overview
The Plant Disease Recognition System is designed to identify various diseases in plants using image processing and machine learning. It helps with early disease detection, which is essential for maintaining plant health and achieving optimal agricultural yield.

Features
Image Capture: Capture high-quality images of plant leaves.
Preprocessing: Prepare images for analysis.
Disease Detection: Identify and classify diseases using a trained machine learning model.
Results Display: Show diagnosis results with confidence levels.
Recommendation: Provide treatment suggestions based on identified diseases.
System Architecture
1. Image Capture
Use a high-resolution camera for capturing images of plant leaves.
Ensure good lighting and focus to avoid blurry images.
2. Preprocessing
Resize: Standardize image size for consistent analysis.
Normalization: Adjust pixel values to improve model performance.
Augmentation: Use techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to enhance dataset diversity.
3. Model Training
Dataset: Use a labeled dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaves.
Model Selection: Choose an appropriate model (e.g., CNN, ResNet).
Training: Train the model with the dataset, using transfer learning if needed.
Validation: Validate the model to ensure it performs well on new data.
4. Disease Detection
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict diseases from the captured image.
Confidence Score: Provide a confidence score for the prediction.
5. Results Display
Show the detected disease and confidence score.
Highlight affected areas on the image.
6. Recommendation
Provide treatment suggestions based on the detected disease.
